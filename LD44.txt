THEME: Your life is currency

Ideas
Aliens give you a scanner to scan interesting humans and you have to scan them to get rewarded.



You're a treasure hunter/wizard? and before you go into each level you can buy stuff from the store with life elixer.
You can find treasure in each level and forge it into heart containers and in the final room there is a fountain where you can fill up the containers and an exit.

At the end there is a boss that takes a lot of hearts to beat?

The best weapons in the shop cost a lot of hearts.
